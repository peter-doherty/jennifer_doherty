A new training from NYC Health + Hospitals/Harlem aims to improve outcomes for pregnant women of color, but does it address concerns for the most at-risk?

The woman on the gurney is dark-skinned, heavyset, middle-aged. In the press release photograph she wears a white hospital gown and her braids are gathered tidily in a bun at the nape of her neck. The doctors and nurses present have just finished executing their roles in delivering her “baby” — a dummy pulled from a manikin attached to her torso.

Before the team can celebrate a job well done, the “patient” begins hemorrhaging. The team must now save her life by asking her the right questions, administering medication, and stopping the bleeding.

The blood is only hypothetical. The patient is an actor participating in a new simulation-based training exercise developed by NYC Health + Hospitals that aims to “teach hospital clinicians on managing maternal hemorrhage and preventing implicit bias.” In New York City black women are 12 times more likely than white women to die from complications related to pregnancy, according to the NYC Health report Pregnancy-Associated Mortality 2006–2010, and experts believe prejudice within the medical system is partially to blame.

The simulation is part of a new training program set to launch at six hospitals across the city in December, but precisely how it addresses issues surrounding race and ethnicity is unclear.

When asked for specifics about how implicit bias is addressed in the training, Bob De Luna, press secretary for NYC Health + Hospitals/Harlem, where the training exercise was developed, replied: “Because our mission is to provide care to all regardless of ability to pay or immigration status, addressing bias associated with cultural difference has long been and will continue to be a focus for us.” De Luna did not respond to follow-up questions.

The report Maternal Morbidity, New York City 2006–2010, released in 2016, startled city agencies into action. Maternal morbidity rates, unlike the more frequently reported maternal mortality rate, refer to the number of women who experience life threatening, but not fatal, health crises related to their pregnancies. The mortality rate counts deaths only. The report listed hemorrhage as the leading cause of maternal mortality for all races except white women.

“I’ve managed many of them,” says Dr. Christina Shenko, referring to post-delivery hemorrhages. Shenko is the Harlem site coordinator for maternity care at the Institute for Family Health, a network of clinics that provide primary healthcare to medically underserved communities. Between her role at the institute, where she is responsible for supervising residents as well as seeing patients, and her own practice in Harlem, she estimates having handled up to 20 postpartum hemorrhages, none deadly. Almost all of her patients are women of color, including a growing number of immigrants from Central Harlem’s Little Senegal neighborhood around West 116th street.

Shenko’s patients reflect a large portion of expecting mothers in New York. The U.S. Census Bureau currently estimates that 40 percent of the city’s total population, over 3 million people, is foreign-born.

On July 20th the Mayor’s office announced a four-point plan to address the crisis. A press release announcing the $12.8 million initiative expounded the importance of “implicit bias training” without specifying what that training should include. The six-page document does not contain a single mention of foreign-born or immigrant women.

“Women from more rural places might not seek care because where they come from there isn’t a doctor. We need to educate on how prenatal care works in this country,” says Shenko. In her experience, problems stem from lack of communication but also from clinicians’ apathy.

“I’ve seen women who’ve walked out of prenatal visits because the practitioner didn’t bother to explain what they were doing before they stuck the ultrasound wand up there and the woman was like ‘I don’t need to be treated like this.’”

Ginny Kapumbu, a French-Congolese web producer, gave birth to all three of her children in New York. “When it comes to the doctor I don’t have much complaints,” she says, “though the last one had huge hands and a ‘let’s get this over with quick’ attitude, and actually hurt me by not being careful, but that’s a whole different conversation.”

All of Kapumbu’s pregnancies were free of complications, and she preferred to stay at home as long as possible before going into the hospital for delivery. “I didn’t feel I was treated any differently than another patient, even though it’s really hard to get an idea of someone else can be treated. I had Medicare back then, but I made sure to choose a good hospital.”

The hospital Kapumbu selected was part of the Mount Sinai system. A spokesperson for Mount Sinai, which delivered over 7000 babies in 2015, by far the most in Manhattan, declined to comment on how it provides care to foreign-born women.

Overall, foreign and native-born women in New York face similar mortality rates during pregnancy. The report totals 22.2 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies for foreign-born women, compared to 21.5 for those born in the U.S.

That consistency disappears when evaluating the data by country of origin. According to a follow-up report, Severe Maternal Morbidity, New York City 2008–2012, nine of the 10 countries of origin for New Yorkers with the highest rate of life-threatening medical crises during pregnancy were either Caribbean or West African. Women who had moved to New York from Haiti are the most at-risk, experiencing an average of 494 life-threatening events per 10,000 pregnancies, followed by St. Vincent, Barbados, and Nigeria. Women from Antigua and Barbuda, number 10 on the list, faced a severe morbidity rate of 366.4, almost 60 percent higher than the rate for women born in the U.S.

Further complicating the issue, different ethnic groups carry unique risks associated with pregnancy. Notably, a 2014 study by St. Michael’s Hospital in Ontario found that across six developed countries, immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa suffered from pre-eclampsia at higher rates than any other region. The condition, which involves high-blood pressure and organ damage, was the third most common cause of maternal mortality among New Yorkers between 2006 and 2010.

Another little-discussed risk factor that disproportionately affects African women in New York is the practice of female genital cutting. Over 25,000 women and girls have undergone or are at risk of cutting in New York state, according to data from the African Women’s Health Center.

“It’s something I, as a physician, felt unprepared for” says Shenko, who regularly sees patients who have undergone the procedure. She says cutting leads to longer labors in her experience. The World Health Organisation further correlates it to increased risk of hemorrhage and longer hospital stays for both mother and baby.

Whatever a woman’s origin, adequate care leading up to her due date may be the difference between life and death. Women who began prenatal care in the first trimester experienced 63 percent fewer life-threatening events than women who received no prenatal care at all according to the Severe Maternal Morbidityreport.

As for doctors’ bias, Shenko thinks it can be challenged, if people are made to do the work. “Truly I think we’ve been dancing around the issue wringing our hands, and things won’t improve until we really have people try to work on their implicit biases individually…It could be interesting to run similar simulations with white and black patients and film it.”

In the meantime, Kapumbu says that like her, most of her African friends have ties to Europe and “so would unlikely have childbirth here and have to pay the overpriced cost of it all.”
