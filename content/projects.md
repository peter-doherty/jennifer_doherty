Digitalization is touted as a lynchpin for cost-effective energy projects and organizations. Today and in the future, organizations need to do more with less, in times of fluctuating energy prices and the big crew change. Furthermore, we need to embrace Digitalization to ensure the industry is compelling enough to attract and keep a younger generation in the workforce.

COORDINATE is a new framework created by [Computation Hub](www.computationhub.com) to help people start, coordinate and deliver upon their digital transformation journey.
