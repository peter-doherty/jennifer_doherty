## Mission
To grow businesses and help teams deliver unique and compelling products or services that empower the customer’s experience. I bring to life novel ideas using the Lean Startup method and my wide range of technical and business experience.

## Trust & Relationships
As a **Business Leader & Entrepreneur**, I maintain meaningful B2B relationships with representatives of large multinationals and startup companies worldwide. I've taken a lead role in identifying, building and maintaining relationships & trust amongst clients. This has resulted in my responsibility to take engineering and software projects from concept through to delivery.

## Background
As a **Chartered Mechanical Engineer** with over ten years' experience in the Upstream Oil & Energy industry, I’ve successfully delivered over 30 subsea engineering projects acting in different roles including Project Engineer, Senior Engineer, and Project Manager. This experience has given me the opportunity to design, analyze and install multi-billion dollar projects in deep and shallow water.

In college, I did two internships at a farm machinery manufacturer, [Major Equipment International Ltd](https://www.major-equipment.com/). This gave me exposure to working with different disciplines and to see the realization of what I was designing with 3D Computer Aided Design software.
