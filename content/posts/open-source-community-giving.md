Open source software is a key presence in our lives today. Most of us don't realise this. It's used to power our mobile phones (Android, iPhone), deliver powerful web frameworks ([vuejs.org](www.vuejs.org), React, Django etc).

As it's open source appreciation month, I thought about sharing my (small) contribution to the open source software community by implementing the [Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/) library into [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/). As a heavy user of open source Javascript libraries, I believe this is a positive way to share a piece of work that others can benefit from.
