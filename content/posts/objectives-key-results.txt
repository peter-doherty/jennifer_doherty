At [Computation Hub](www.computation hu), we list out our objectives at the beginning of each quarter because this helps us focus on our strategy in manageable “sprints”. Around the midpoint, the management team gets together and reviews progress. At the end of the quarter, we assess the final score and key results. Subsequently, we then redefine new objectives or carry over objectives to the next quarter depending on the success from the previous quarter. 

Sometimes, we might just discard a failing objective if we see it has no hope of success. But the key result is still tracked for later reference.

This tool is sort of hacked together based on what is used at Google and other tech companies. I find it works quite well and is very stripped down and easy to work through. 

This method allows us to review objectives easily in a collaborative manner. You can view a clean version here. In our working version (not shown), we used basic code to automate the conclusions based on averaged scoring. This gave us the following assessment classes:

* Mid-Term assessment can be “On Track” or “Behind”
* End of Term assessments can be “Good Performance” or “Improvement needed”
