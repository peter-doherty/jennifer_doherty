This post continues on from my previous article called “High-level steps to creating a startup in France”. Here, I go into the details that we went through to create our company, Computation Hub. 

This guide relates to creating a Société par actions simplifiée (known as SAS) in France, with at least one co-founder. There are other company types depending on your needs (etc. SARL, SASU) but I’ll just focus the SAS here.

Herebelow, I break it down into sequential steps by category where possible.

Company Bylaws & Co-Founder Agreement (Projet de Statuts)
Several options are available regards how to do this. Bullet Points 1 & 2 below are optional but pick one of them that suits your resources and objectives.

Request a startup pack on Captain Contrat (optional)
Contact a lawyer familiar with creating a company in France (optional)
Once received, review the copy of the company bylaws and co-founder agreement (“Projet de Statuts”)
Go through to points 1–6 of “Bank Account” below
Update the “Projet de Statuts” with your bank address and siege social address
Sign the “Projet de Statuts” with your co-founder
Bank Account
Open a share capital account with your bank to obtain a “Certificat de dépôt de fonds”
Bring a copy of the company bylaws (unsigned will do)
Deposit your part of the capital pertaining to your equity holding
Have your co-founder deposit their part of the capital pertaining to their equity holding
Send both of your “justificatif virement” to your banker
Obtain the depot de fonds cert from your bank
Send the depot de fonds to your lawyer
Go to step 5 of “Company bylaws & Co-Founder Agreement (Projet de Statues)” above
Siege Social
Send a copy of the company bye-laws and co-founder agreement to your service provider
Provide an accountant's name that looks after your financial aspects
Provide a copy of your ID and any household bills (that prove you live in France) you have
Sign the contract you receive
Send this contract to your lawyer
When you receive a copy of your “K-BIS” send this to your provider of the address for your “Siege social”
Final Thoughts
It is a time consuming effort when you really want to be meeting your prospective customers or building in a feature to your product. Patience is definitely a must. I suggest that you do this between the months of September and December and/or January to April. 

Public holidays are numerous in May, June, July and August. Pay attention to the calendar! Also, you should consider days off or holidays that the people you deal with may take, in addition to public holidays.

You could create the company without any aid from a legal professional but I strongly recommend that you do get legal advice because it could end up being painful when you hit a speed bump at some stage along your journey. 

Overall, we had over 100 pages of documents to review and sign. Blockchain can’t come quick enough!
