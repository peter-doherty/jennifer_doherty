At the heart of any great product is a great user experience (UX). The same applies for services too. One thing I noticed recently, was a trend on Twitter where people have been sharing their bad experiences especially when visiting web pages.

How often have you opened a website and start to read the content when a pop-up chat window appears? Be it a Cookie notice, request to know your location, request to send you updates. It seems that as companies strive for growth and comply with GDPR, they have turned a blind eye to their exist users.

Coincidentally, I had been having a small fight with LinkedIn web client on my phone.

#### Dirty Tactics?

I hadn't installed the native LinkedIn app on my phone due to lack of space. Yet, upon opening the site on my browser, it kept prompting me to "continue with mobile web" or "continue". The way they present the options to proceed is a little deceiving if you speed-read their instructions. "Continue" brings you to the app store and to the app download screen - not what I wanted. "Continue with mobile web", well, has some sort of feature coded into it, where you can "continue to mobile web" after hammering the button at least half a dozen times. Awesome!

At first, I thought my phone wasn't working but LinkedIn know what they are doing here. After a test on another device I observed the same behavior. I continued to use the mobile client after clearing the LinkedIn prompt. But the terror didn't end there.

#### Never Miss a Post

Within the mobile client, I received a new prompt. Did you guess correctly? Yes, it was to download their native app, but as you correctly guessed again - I ignored it. This time, clicking "X", works immediately.

Not content in letting me away with my disobedience, LinkedIn caught up with me on their desktop client too.

The goal for LinkedIn here, to me, appears to have one use their mobile app to harvest more data about users. This is their core business. It's a shame that they offer a bad experience here.

#### The Web Today

n our web experience today, we're bombarded with notifications daily. Technology is supposed to make our lives easier. Yet, it seems to the opposite - more stress, more addiction and more distractions from what we should be doing at work or at home.

#### Design Is Empathy

This post shouldn't be interpreted as a rant against LinkedIn but a request for relief from repeated calls to action. Unexpected and repeated prompts ruin a user experience in my opinion. Entrepreneurs always hear/preach that we should put the customer at the heart of the design process. At a tech conference recently, I heard a speaker say "Design is empathy." How that phrase is lost in the tech world today.
