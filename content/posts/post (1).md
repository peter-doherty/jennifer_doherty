_An annual film series brings together one of New York City’s smallest immigrant communities for a showcase of pride and potential_

The short film “E’ville” begins with Patrice Lumumba’s final letter to his wife, written in 1961: “My darling companion, I write these words without knowing if they will reach you…or if I will still be alive when you read them. All through my struggle for the independence of my country, I have never doubted for a single moment the final triumph of the sacred cause to which my companions and I dedicated our life. But what we wished for our country: its right to an honorable life, to an unstained dignity, to a liberty without restrictions that Belgian colonialism and its Western allies…deliberately and not deliberately, never wanted.”

Following the voiceover, filmmaker Nelson Makengo turns his camera to the modern day Democratic Republic of Congo, to an abandoned sports center in Lubumbashi, known in colonial times as Elizabethville, or E‑ville. Today, its Olympic swimming pool is clogged with litter, a toxic green puddle filling the deep end. Throughout the 12 minute film, Makengo overlays past and present, suggesting that the optimism of the past is not dead, despite current indignities.

“E’ville” will make its U.S. debut this week at [Congo in Harlem](http://www.congoinharlem.org/). The film festival, which runs through Oct. 21 at the Maysles Documentary Center (343 Lenox Ave), is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year and its first iteration since President Trump made headlines with his reported “shithole countries” comment in January. The event provides a forum for Congolese filmmakers to showcase their work and for Congolese New Yorkers to gather and celebrate a heritage of resiliency — one that may take on new prominence with current immigration policy.

Congolese nationals are thin on the ground in New York City compared to other African communities, but nationally, they represent the largest incoming refugee population, with 6,011 resettlements in the first eight months of 2018, almost a third of the 18,214 global year-to-date admissions. Locally, resettlement agencies have placed hundreds in Buffalo and Newark in recent years. Farther afield, large communities have also sprung up in cities including Dallas and Boston.

To filmmaker Sarah Kazadi, who immigrated to New York as a teenager, Congo in Harlem plays a “unifying role” for Congolese in the city.

“We know where to find each other,” she says, explaining that the local Congolese community comes together for major life events, but isn’t motivated to form associations the way other groups, like Harlem’s Little Senegal neighborhood or the Staten Island-based Nigerian Community Association, have.

She hesitates to attribute a reason for the reluctance, but points to language barriers as a main sticking point for Congolese arriving in the US. According to the Cultural Services of the French Embassy, the DRC holds the second largest French-speaking population in the world. French has been spoken in Congo since Belgian colonization in 1908, and has been the official language since independence in 1960, though most people speak one of several local languages at home.

Like most of the films screened at Congo in Harlem, Kazadi’s 2015 entry “Telema,” about a political activist who was jailed for standing up to the DRC’s president, is mostly in French. Kazadi recalls being particularly moved by an animated feature in Lingala she saw at Congo in Harlem the same year “Telema” ran.

Congo in Harlem founders Lynn True and Nelson Walker are excited to see more and more Congolese filmmakers taking risks like speaking their own languages and experimenting with more avant garde techniques, as in “E’ville”.

The couple started the series after travelling to Congo to film their documentary “Lumo,” which follows a victim of war rape in her quest for medical care. They wanted to present a richer, more textured image of the country they had witnessed, an experience True felt had been “sorely misrepresented” by the narratives about the DRC available to Western audiences.

Ten years later, True and Walker still return to the DRC regularly to teach film workshops. Makengo is one of their former students. Meanwhile, the West still has a lot to learn. “I think that the current political situation in the States, if anything only… affirms our original goal for this series, how important it is to not reduce any one person or place to one specific representation,” says True.

New York’s Congolese cinephiles are unphased by the Trump administration. “I just think that they are misinformed. They’re uneducated. The more I was exposed to other cultures, the less judgmental I became,” says Marius Mufuta, a regular Congo in Harlem attendee who holds a master’s degree from Hekima College Institute of Peace Studies and International Relations in Kenya.

Mufuta first moved to New York for an internship with the UN’s Global Forum on Hate Speech. With his prominence in academia growing, he feared repercussions in his home country and applied for asylum at the end of his internship in December 2015. His request was approved this past March. Today he works at RIF Asylum Support, connecting new refugees and asylum applicants with potential employers.

He spends his free time doing what he calls “consulting” for political actors back in Congo. He keeps a hand in current events there and plans to return one day. Rather than focus on building a community of Congolese in New York, he says “The people with whom I like to surround myself are the people who share my vision.”

One person who shares Mufuta’s vision of a well-governed DRC free of Western corporate interference is Vita Kabasele. The two met at Congo in Harlem last year.

Kabasele is the New York representative of the advocacy group [Friends of the Congo](https://friendsofthecongo.org/mission-vision/), whose mission is to “raise the consciousness of the world community on the challenge of the Congo and support Congolese institutions in bringing about a peaceful and lasting change.” The organization co-hosts Congo in Harlem as part of its annual Congo Week initiative to promote the DRC’s natural and human potential.

Since obtaining his green card through the Diversity Immigrant Visa program, often referred to as the “green card lottery” and moving to the United States from the Democratic Republic of Congo five years ago, Kabasele has embodied quite a bit of that potential. Along with his work at Friends of the Congo, he coaches youth soccer, works as a restaurant host, and does film and photography for Le Frenchy Show, a French-language web series exploring New York through the eyes of expats.

In 2014, the year he was selected, a record 61,942 green cards were awarded to people from Africa. The lottery has awarded more green cards to Africans than to any other region each year since. President Trump has repeatedly spoken about his intent to do away with this system, saying he prefers “merit based” migration policies

Kabasele isn’t cowed by Trump, but neither is he sold on America, and just because he’s good at it, doesn’t mean he likes the hustle. “Back home, not really knowing about what the capitalism is, arriving here then having to deal with it, isn’t an easy thing. Money over everything. Over nature, over value or truth. Work, work, work and work that you barely have time to think or do anything else,” says Kabasele, expressing his distaste via text message as he dashed from one commitment to another on a recent Saturday afternoon in true New York style.

Kabasele has a timeline for his own move back to the DRC, where he plans to launch his own career as a filmmaker with the producer of Le Frenchy Show. While he once thought that “life was everywhere else but Congo,” he says living in New York opened up his eyes to the nobility of his own culture, and to the need to reclaim it from the persistent shadow of colonialism.

Again texting as he rushed between a work engagement and a friend’s birthday party: “I wound up deciding two years ago that I had to go back home…so I can help to change the mentality of our people on the ground and do my best so that no other member of my family, direct or indirect, will ever again need to leave Africa.”
