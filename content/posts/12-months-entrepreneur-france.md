Around this time last year, I set out on the bumpy road of Entrepreneurship. It was a daunting task at first — attempting to go through the infamous French Bureaucracy to create a company. Plus, the fact I had experience as a foreigner setting up in France made me think twice! Anyway, it has been very exciting so far. In this article, I share what I have learned and share what we have been doing at Computation Hub to date.

There is a classic saying used by Salesmen — “ABC Always be Closing”. Regards, building a startup, I think it should be “ABT Always be Testing”. When you start out, for example, one should always be testing:

* Ideas to make your team more efficient
* Projects for your customers
* Ways to achieve your objectives & goals successfully

A startup is full of uncertainty and plenty of risks. I think as an Entrepreneur it is all about reducing these threats to your startup and those risks your customer or prospect perceive in you. It involves a lot of testing and “leaps of faith” as well as patience and perseverance to follow through on what you set out to do.

In France, the new President Emmanuel Macron is putting huge support behind start-ups. Moreover, there are several channels of support available for you start-ups or sole entrepreneurs (e.g. Crédit d’impôt recherche, Jeune Entreprise Innovante and Banque Publique d’Investissement).

This can be favourable for your company but also to your potential customer/client. In fact, some may ask if you already receive support from the aforementioned channels. It’s a win-win situation for both sides.

Additionally, there are also organisations in the Oil & Gas industry who are implementing their Digital Transformation Strategies (to combat lower for longer oil prices) and using start-ups to help them on their journey.

At Computation Hub, we believe that data driven Software-as-a-Service solutions are a smarter and less intensive capital expenditure investment than developing internal solutions. Personally, I believe that these kinds of services can save many millions of dollars in CAPEX and OPEX for operators and contractors.

Today, we are working on developing our PROLAY service for subsea pipeline and subsea power cable installation. Moreover, we are in the early stages of planning a Proof of Concept which aims to demonstrate enhanced integrity monitoring and operational insights for in-place spools, flowlines and power cables. This service is targeted at operators — so feel free to get in touch with us if you want to get involved as a development partner.
