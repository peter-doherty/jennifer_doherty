I recently entered the world of entrepreneurship with the goal of building a technology startup to serve the engineering sector in the Energy Industry (more on that soon). Why did I do this? What was my motivation?

Whilst lazing around on the couch one weekend, I stumbled across a TEDx talk on YouTube by Massimo Banzi, Founder of Arduino (My fiancé bought me an Arduino Starter Kit). In his talk I came across a compelling argument/quote: “You don’t need permission to create something great”. This had a serious impact on me. Could I apply this to myself? Is this a catalyst to change my career?

Around this time, my friend Jean Charles Touzalin had just finished his 1st year as Co-Founder and CTO at Running Heroes. I admired his spirit and courage to create a unique business. I thought, should I pursue my ideas? I just needed the right idea to start, then execute it (plus motivation and energy).

I toyed with some online businesses that I thought I could automate and generate some side income. They were pretty terrible ideas and I didn’t properly pay attention to them or more importantly execute them properly. I had no real experience in those areas and did not commit to them wholeheartedly, thus I guess they could be classed as failures? Listening to Massimo, observing Jean Charles’ path and meeting other new friends who also founded their own companies, had ignited my desire to start something new and to create a company that would change/disrupt the market that it operated in.

Being an entrepreneur allows for freedom to test and explore ideas that one might have, whilst taking some personal risk in realising his/her dream. This may not always be possible when one is working for an organisation who has particular goals and business strategy. Personally, I think it’s good practice for entrepreneurs, engineers or whatever your role maybe, to explore and test to see what works. Maybe like what one can do with the Arduino Starter Kit!

I hope that if you are reading this article that you perhaps are a newbie entrepreneur or are setting out to become one. If you are, here are some of my main learnings so far:

Think about what you want to do with your career;
Talk to your family and/or network of friends who might inspire you to become an entrepreneur;
You need to have some bad ideas to find a good idea;
Once you settle on the idea, execute it;
Think about starting in a market that is familiar to you — it’s less risky in my opinion;
Don’t be afraid of failure — it’s good to fail but do it fast not slow.
