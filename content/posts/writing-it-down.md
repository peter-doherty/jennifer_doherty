Writing is a good way of gathering thoughts and ideas. Writing it down, can be a positive and expressive outlet. Yet in 2018, I managed one post. So, this year, I am aiming to fix that by posting at least once per week. I plan to write about startups, entrepreneurship, technology, oil & energy and post some tech guides. I hope that by writing here regularly, it would boost my creativity, hone my writing and improve communication skills.

Hopefully, my posts will offer some value and be interesting to readers.
