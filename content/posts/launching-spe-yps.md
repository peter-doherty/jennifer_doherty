The 2018 program for Young Professional's (YP's) kicked off in La DÃ©fense, Paris last night. The YP programme is part of SPE France which delivers a wider programme of events in France for all ages. Follow the company page on Linkedin for the latest news or join the association by emailing: contact@spefrance.org

This year three activity types will be developed under the YP program:

1. Lunch & Learn
2. Evening Debate
3. Beyond The Borders

Get in touch via **yp@spefrance.org**, Guillaume Navez, Alvin Low or myself if you wish to join the YP community, attend SPE events or propose suggestions for activities. We have outlined pertinent industry topics to be discussed at these events but we would love to hear from you!

What do you think should be discussed?
