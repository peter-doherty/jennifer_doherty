## Introduction

Digitalization is firmly part of the future in the Oil & Energy sector. [Computation Hub](www.computationhub.com) is proud to announce a **new monthly online event called Oil & Energy Digital Digest**. The **goal** is to have a conversation one-on-one about digitalization and the associated impacts.

Every month a new theme will be chosen based on attendee feedback. To kick-off this free initiative, the first event will take place on the **26th February 2019 (details below)** and will ask the question:

> Can digitalization improve your productivity rate?

## Why You Should Attend

There are many shared technologies and lessons across our respective domains of expertise but there is a lack of cross-pollination between our industries. With this format, we can help empower one another by sharing experiences. It is also a chance to network with new people from **around the world for free** and with little effort.

Meeting and speaking to a new person 1-on-1 via video can help inspire one another with new ideas and motivation.

## How It Works

Attendees will have **5 mins to check-in** for the **60 mins** event. Then, they will talk 1-on-1 with **six** other attendees for **9 mins each**.

You'll be automatically matched with other attendees based on your role with the industry.

This event is marked as **a sales / pitch free event**. Please be kind and respectful to one another.

**For anyone new to the Meetaway format**, Meetaways are online events that intelligently match attendees for a series of 1-on-1 video calls. After each conversation, attendees automatically rotate to the next one. You just log in to the event and Meetaway will handle the rest.

Additionally, you'll want to join the event on a **laptop or desktop with Chrome or Firefox.** Meetaway does not support mobile devices because the screen movements are often distracting and having everyone on a laptop or desktop results in a better overall experience for everyone. Please read the terms and conditions at meetaway.com if you have any query.
