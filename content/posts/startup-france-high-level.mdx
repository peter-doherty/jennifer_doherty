I have just got through the mental hurdle of creating a company in France. As two foreigners living in France for over 18 years combined, we were well used to French Bureaucracy from a citizen's viewpoint. Those trips to the bank and receiving a large spruce tree in term of papers when you create a bank account. Those numerous trips to stand in never ending queues at the local l’Assurance Maladie office (which do not believe in air conditioning) to get a Carte Vitale. 

This a high-level description of the steps that we needed to take when creating the company. We were mentally and emotionally prepared (and you need to be too) to repeat all of that, but in terms of setting up an organisation:

1. Find an accelerator or incubator program (you can access contacts, leverage feedback from others etc.)
Find a bank that will offer you business services (we chose my personal bank as there was already an existing relationship)
2. Find a “siege social” which is your legal address for the company (This the head office where the legal entity is located)
3. Find a lawyer (we chose Captain Contrat) to create a co-founders agreement and company bylaws document
4. Compile electronic copies of passports, household bills (e.g. rent, electricity)
5. Find a good printer and automated scanner (for all the documents you need to print, sign with initials on each page and upload online)
6. Use Google Drive to organise the documents you receive and send
7. Trello to manage everything
8. Slack to communicate internally

Thankfully, there are some really great services tackling French Bureaucracy. Captain Contrat, which we used successfully, is an online legal service that can help you with many legal documents. They have an awesome support service and their prices are way better than going through large established law firms.

A point to note and that was highlighted by another Entrepreneur, when we were comparing other online legal services, is that the paperwork, although based on templates is prepared, reviewed and signed off by a lawyer at the Paris Bar.

It should be noted that I have assumed that you already have found a co-founder or co-founders. If you would like to hear about how Samuel and I met, let me know!

In my next post “Low-level steps to creating a startup in France” I will go through the steps in a little more detail.
