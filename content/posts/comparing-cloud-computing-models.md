Cloud computing is a modern way of hosting and accessing software applications, data storage and compute power over the Internet. The power of the Cloud allows your IT team to focus business needs and less focus on tasks such as procurement of servers, capacity planning and other related <a href="/resources/blog/Top-7-benefits-that-make-Software-as-a-Service-unique" target="_blank"> topics</a>.

**Cloud Computing Deployment Models**

Cloud Computing can be **_deployed in three ways_** to deliver services towards your assets, operations and teams.

*_1. Private Cloud_*

This model is similar to the traditional on-premises deployment model where resources use virtualisation and resource management capabilities. This model does not bring the associated cost savings or flexibility associated with the public cloud model. It does, however, allow the end user/organisation to control and customise the cloud to meet their specifications. As a result, this restricts the scalability and flexibility of the offering yet ensures comfortable levels of security (data, user information etc.) provided in-house security practices are set in place.

*_2. Public Cloud_*

This is the most common Cloud model that comes to mind when the discussion of Public Cloud comes up. Public Cloud is a multi-tenant model, typically offered by a vendor such as Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud or Amazon Web Services. This model deploys and runs an application fully in a public, off-premises Cloud. The main benefits associated with this approach are lower software Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and substantial agility - access to pay-as-you-go, on-demand storage and compute power. Where data security is not a top-level concern, applications are suited to this model type.

*_3. Hybrid Cloud_*

Hybrid Cloud is a mixture of the two previous models described - they remain separate but are linked together giving some flexibility when demand cannot be served solely in private Cloud. Applications can be deployed in the private cloud and associated data stored on-premises. This is due to concerns about data security and ownership. When usage spikes access can be connected to a Public Cloud to obtain more flexible compute power and storage access.

The main concerns with the Cloud are security and control. The level of sensitivity relating to the data you are managing can mean that the benefits of lower TCO (associated with public cloud) is sacrificed.

When data sensitivity is low, then the public cloud can be considered but the level of control is reduced as the Cloud vendor is responsible for configuration management.

**Services**

The Cloud allows you to deliver three different service types within your organisation. Each service has a different function depending on the resources available and the flexibility desired. 

Cloud Computing is growing at substantial [rates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2016/03/13/roundup-of-cloud-computing-forecasts-and-market-estimates-2016/#42a9443e2187) and is definitely an option considered by organisations when deciding how to manage their way of working.
